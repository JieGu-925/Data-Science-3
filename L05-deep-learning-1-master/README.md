# L05 Deep Learning I

Download the repository as a zip folder and begin an R project for this lab. The zip folder will contain instructions (repeated below) and a template to get an Rmd file started.

# Overview

The goal of this lab is ensure that we are able to actually fit neural networks using the `keras` and `tensorflow` packages in R. We want to ensure that we can recreate the examples in provided in Chapters 2 and 3 in *Deep Learning with R*.

When creating the Rmd file for this assignment, you won't want all your code chunks to evaluate because it would take to long to run. You'll want to produce results, store them in a subdirectory, and then reference them in the Rmd file. You may need to use hidden chunks of code to read in results or use Rmd code to insert graphics that you want to display. **Make sure to thoroughly comment and describe what the code is doing in our own words.**

Author provides great [notebooks on github](https://github.com/jjallaire/deep-learning-with-r-notebooks) to go along with the book.

# Datasets 

All datasets are supplied by the `keras` package --- `mnist`, `imdb`, `rueters`, and `boston_housing`.

# Exercises

Please complete the following exercises. The document should be neatly formatted.
