# Processed Data

File contains the processed dataset - maybe datasets. That is, the data is now ready for an EDA and for future analyses. It may be useful to save the data in both a `.rds` and `.csv` format. 

# Codebook

A variable codebook should also be included for each dataset. Might consider a condensed codebook displayed in this document for quick reference.
